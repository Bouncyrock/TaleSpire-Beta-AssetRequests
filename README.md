<h1>TaleSpire Beta Asset Requests</h1>

Hi, thank you for checking out The Beta Asset Request hub.

This place is intended for the community to present wishes for tiles, props, and miniatures. Requests could be extended content for current sets or completely new content. 

**The way this works is:**
 * Go to the `Issues` tab on top. Look/Search through the current "Issues" to see if anything is matching the request you want to make. If it already exists as an entry, you can add a :thumbsup:[thumbs up reaction] to the original message to add your vote. 

 * If nothing quite fits, file a new "Issue" and fill in the Template.

We'll be sorting by the :thumbsup:[thumbs up reaction] internally to gauge interest, but this list will not be a blueprint for what TaleSpire will eventually contain nor in what order assets will be created.

_Thank you all for making requests! _
