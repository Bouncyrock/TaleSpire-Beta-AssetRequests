<h1>TaleSpire Beta Asset Requests</h1>

Hi, thank you for checking out The Beta Asset Request hub.

This place is intended for the community to present wishes for tiles, props, and miniatures. Requests could be extended content for current sets or completely new content. 

**The way this works is:**
 * Go to the `Issues` tab on top. Look/Search through the current "Issues" to see if anything is matching. If it already exists as an entry, you can add a :thumbsup:[thumbs up reaction] to the original message. 

 * If nothing quite fits, file a new "Issue" and fill in the Template.

We'll be sorting by the :thumbsup:[thumbs up reaction] internally, so this is used to gauge interest.

**Disclaimer:**
_Thank you all for making requests. We will be using this list to prioritize what to do when. As well as keep an eye on what the community ultimately wants to see in TaleSpire. This list will not be a blueprint for what TaleSpire will eventually contain nor in what order assets will be created._
